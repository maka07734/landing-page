FINAL VERSION:
My imaginary client is a Data Analyst named MK. They've requested a landing page for their data analysis project portfolio. In providing the included style guide, they had requested a general, vague design. I met their requirements initially, and after presenting them with a jazzed-up version (same basic format, but improved use of color) the client agreed to go with my design.

ACCESSIBILITY (my addition to this exercise):
WCAG 2.1 standards are applied as appropriate to support accessibility best practices.
